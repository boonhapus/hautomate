# Custom Component Configuration

This is a sample configuration that enables you to run `hautomate` as a custom
component within the HomeAssistant ecosystem.

Your `apps/` directory can live anywhere you want it to live, as long as it is
accessible by the Home Assistant instance! In your configuration of
`hautomate`, you will point Home Assistant to the `apps/` directory.

## Installation

 1. Ensure you have a `custom_components/` directory in your config directory.
